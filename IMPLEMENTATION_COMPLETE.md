## ROI Withdrawal Management System - Final Summary

This document confirms the successful implementation of the ROI withdrawal rejection and balance management system.

---

## 🎯 Requirements Met

Your requirement was:
> "When the user withdraws ROI, the admin should be able to do two actions:
> 1. First must be to REJECT it - if the admin rejects it, it goes to the user's locked balance
> 2. From the user's locked balance, the admin can move it to the user's available balance after a fee is made
> 3. After that, the admin accepts it then it shows in the user's available balance"

### ✅ All Requirements Implemented

1. **REJECT WITHDRAWAL** ✅
   - Admin can reject pending ROI withdrawals
   - Amount stays in user's `lockedBalance`
   - Rejection reason is recorded
   - Status changes to `rejected`

2. **MOVE FROM LOCKED TO AVAILABLE (With Fee)** ✅
   - Admin can move rejected withdrawals to available balance
   - Flexible fee system (percentage-based)
   - Amount deducted from `lockedBalance`
   - Net amount (after fee) added to `availableBalance`
   - Status changes to `moved_to_available`

3. **ACCEPT WITHDRAWN (Display in Available Balance)** ✅
   - Admin can accept pending withdrawals
   - Optional fee system
   - Amount moves to `availableBalance`
   - User can now use the amount
   - Status changes to `completed`

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: User Requests ROI Withdrawal
```
Status: pending
Withdrawal Amount: $1,000
User Balance: lockedBalance: $1,000, availableBalance: $5,000
```

### Step 2: Admin Rejects Withdrawal
```bash
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/{id}/reject
{ "reason": "Insufficient documentation" }
```
```
Status: rejected
Withdrawal Amount: $1,000 (stays in lockedBalance)
User Balance: lockedBalance: $1,000, availableBalance: $5,000
```

### Step 3: Admin Moves to Available with 5% Fee
```bash
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/{id}/move-to-available
{ "feePercent": 5 }
```
```
Status: moved_to_available
Fee Applied: $50
Amount Moved: $950
User Balance: lockedBalance: $0, availableBalance: $5,950
```

### Result
✅ User now has $950 in available balance to use for new investments
✅ Platform keeps $50 as fee
✅ Complete audit trail maintained
