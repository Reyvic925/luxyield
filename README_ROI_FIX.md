## 🔴 The Problem (What You Reported)

```
User had $26,507 in investment value but couldn't withdraw any ROI
availableBalance: $0 ❌
Result: "Insufficient balance" error ❌
```

**Root Cause:** ROI was added to investment currentValue but NOT to user's availableBalance

---

## ✅ The Solution (What Was Fixed)

### 3 Critical Fixes:

1. **Daily ROI Script** - Now credits ROI to availableBalance
2. **ROI Cron Simulator** - Now credits ROI gains to availableBalance  
3. **Withdrawal Endpoint** - Now uses availableBalance instead of depositBalance

  Available Balance: $2.50 ✅ 
  
Verification: PASS ✅
Result: User can now withdraw $2.50 ROI ✅
