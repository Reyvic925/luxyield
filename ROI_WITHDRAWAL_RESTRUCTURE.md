**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🔄 The New Flow

### Phase 1: Investment Active (Days/Weeks)
```
User deposits $5,000
     ↓
Investment starts earning ROI
     ↓
System credits ROI to investment.currentValue ONLY
     ↓
Day 7: currentValue = $5,750 (includes ROI)
     ↓
user.availableBalance = $0 (ROI is NOT here)
user.lockedBalance = $0 (investment still active)
```

### Phase 2: Investment Matures (Auto)
```
endDate passes
     ↓
Investment auto-completes
     ↓
Entire currentValue ($5,750) moves to user.lockedBalance
     ↓
Investment becomes read-only
     ↓
user.availableBalance = $0
user.lockedBalance = $5,750 (pending admin approval)
```

### Phase 3: User Requests Withdrawal
```
User clicks "Withdraw ROI"
     ↓
System calculates: ROI = $5,750 - $5,000 = $750
     ↓
Creates Withdrawal record (type='roi', status='pending')
     ↓
Amount stays in user.lockedBalance
     ↓
Admin sees pending ROI withdrawal for review
```

### Phase 4: Admin Approves
```
Admin reviews withdrawal request
     ↓
Admin clicks "Approve"
     ↓
System calculates any fees
     ↓
Moves amount from lockedBalance → availableBalance
     ↓
user.availableBalance = $750
user.lockedBalance = $5,000
     ↓
Withdrawal marked as 'confirmed'
```

### Phase 5: User Withdraws to Crypto
```
User goes to withdrawal page
     ↓
User has $750 availableBalance to withdraw
     ↓
User enters crypto details (BTC/ETH/USDT address)
     ↓
System converts to crypto and sends
```

## 📝 Files Changed

### 1. ✅ `server/scripts/update_roi.js`
**What Changed:**
- ROI no longer credited to availableBalance
- When investment ends, entire currentValue moves to lockedBalance

**Before:**
```javascript
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { $inc: { availableBalance: roiAmount } });
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ROI stays in investment.currentValue only
// When investment ends:
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(inv.user, { $inc: { lockedBalance: currentValue } });
```

### 2. ✅ `server/utils/roiCalculator.js`
**What Changed:**
- ROI gains no longer credited to availableBalance
- When investment matures (every 5 min cron), entire currentValue moves to lockedBalance

**Before:**
```javascript
if (fluctuation > 0) {
  await User.findByIdAndUpdate(invDoc.user, { $inc: { availableBalance: fluctuation } });
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ROI stays in investment.currentValue only
// When matured:
const currentValue = invDoc.currentValue;
await User.findByIdAndUpdate(invDoc.user, { $inc: { lockedBalance: currentValue } });
```

### 3. ✅ `server/routes/admin.js`
**What Added:**
- New endpoint: `POST /admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds`
- Allows admin to manually move funds from locked → available

**Endpoint:**
```javascript
POST /api/admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds
Body: {
  amount: 1000,
  reason: "Investment completed"
}
```

### 4. ✅ `server/routes/investment.js`
**Status:** No changes needed
- Already correctly moves ROI to lockedBalance
- Already has pending withdrawal workflow

### 5. ✅ `server/routes/withdrawal.js`
**Status:** No changes needed
- Already checks availableBalance
- Already prevents over-withdrawal

## 💰 User Balance Explanation

### `availableBalance`
- Money user can **immediately withdraw** to crypto wallet
- Sources:
  - Initial deposits (after admin confirms)
  - Completed investments moved to available (after admin approves)
- **NOT included:** ROI during investment period, completed investments pending approval

### `lockedBalance`
- Money **pending admin approval**
- Sources:
  - Completed investments (pending release)
  - ROI submitted for withdrawal (pending approval)
- **Blocked from:** Cannot be withdrawn to crypto without admin approval
- **Used for:** Display in "locked" section of portfolio

---

## 🎯 Admin Workflow

### For Completed Investments

**Option A: Manual Release** (Quick approve)
```
Admin sees completed investment in user's portfolio
     ↓
Admin clicks "Release to Available"
     ↓
POST /api/admin/users/:userId/release-locked-funds
Body: { amount: 5750, reason: "Investment completed" }
     ↓
User sees $5,750 in availableBalance
     ↓
User can now withdraw to wallet
```

**Option B: User Initiates ROI Withdrawal** (Normal flow)
```
User clicks "Withdraw ROI" on completed investment
     ↓
POST /api/investment/withdraw-roi/:investmentId
     ↓
Withdrawal created with type='roi', status='pending'
     ↓
Admin reviews in "Pending ROI Withdrawals"
     ↓
Admin approves: POST /api/admin/roi-withdrawals/:id/accept
     ↓
Amount moves from lockedBalance → availableBalance
     ↓
User can now withdraw to wallet
```
