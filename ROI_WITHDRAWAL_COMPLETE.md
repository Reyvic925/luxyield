# ✅ ROI WITHDRAWAL SYSTEM - COMPLETE (Feb 17, 2026)

## Summary

The ROI withdrawal system has been **fully implemented and optimized** as requested.

---

## 🎯 The Final Flow

### **User withdraws ROI with ONE CLICK from investment:**

```
User clicks "Withdraw ROI"
        ↓
Calculates: ROI = currentValue - principal
        ↓
IMMEDIATELY:
• Deducts ROI from investment.currentValue
• Moves ROI to user.lockedBalance
• Marks investment as roiWithdrawn: true
        ↓
ADMIN then:
• Reviews withdrawal request
• Clicks "Approve"
• Moves from lockedBalance → availableBalance
        ↓
USER finally:
• Withdraws to crypto wallet
```

## 📝 Implementation

### **File Updated:** `server/routes/investment.js`

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/investment/withdraw-roi/:investmentId`

**What Happens:**

```javascript
// 1. Calculate ROI
const roi = investment.currentValue - investment.amount;

// 2. Deduct from investment IMMEDIATELY
investment.currentValue -= roi;                          // KEY: Direct deduction
investment.roiWithdrawn = true;
investment.transactions.push({ type: 'withdrawal', amount: roi });
await investment.save();

// 3. Move to lockedBalance IMMEDIATELY
user.lockedBalance += roi;                               // KEY: Direct transfer
await user.save();

// 4. Create withdrawal record for admin
const withdrawal = new Withdrawal({ 
  amount: roi, 
  type: 'roi', 
  status: 'pending' 
});
await withdrawal.save();

// 5. Return response
return {
  success: true,
  roi: $750,
  investment: { 
    currentValue: $5000,  // ROI removed
    roiWithdrawn: true 
  },
  lockedBalance: $750,
  message: 'ROI withdrawn successfully! Awaiting admin approval.'
}
```
