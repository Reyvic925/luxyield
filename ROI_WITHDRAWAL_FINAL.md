# ✅ ROI WITHDRAWAL - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION (Feb 17, 2026)

## What Changed

The ROI withdrawal flow is now **simpler and cleaner**:

### **User withdraws ROI directly from investment with ONE click:**

1. Investment shows: `Current Value: $5,750`
2. User clicks: **"Withdraw ROI"** button
3. **Immediately:**
   - ROI ($750) deducted from `investment.currentValue` → $5,000
   - ROI moved to `user.lockedBalance`
   - Investment marked: `roiWithdrawn: true`
4. **Admin then:**
   - Reviews withdrawal
   - Approves with one click
   - Moves from `lockedBalance` → `availableBalance`
5. **User finally:**
   - Withdraws to crypto wallet

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Updated: `server/routes/investment.js`

**When user calls: `POST /api/investment/withdraw-roi/:investmentId`**

```javascript
// 1. Calculate ROI
const roi = investment.currentValue - investment.amount;  // e.g., $750

// 2. Deduct from investment immediately
investment.currentValue -= roi;                           // $5,750 → $5,000
investment.roiWithdrawn = true;
await investment.save();

// 3. Move to lockedBalance immediately
user.lockedBalance += roi;                                // +$750
await user.save();

// 4. Create withdrawal record for admin approval
const withdrawal = new Withdrawal({
  amount: roi,
  type: 'roi',
  status: 'pending'
});
await withdrawal.save();

// 5. Return response
return {
  success: true,
  roi: $750,
  investment: { currentValue: $5000, roiWithdrawn: true },
  lockedBalance: $750,
  message: 'ROI withdrawn! Awaiting admin approval.'
}
```

## 💰 Complete Flow Example

```
STEP 1: User Investment
├─ Principal: $5,000
├─ Current Value: $5,750 (with $750 ROI)
├─ Status: COMPLETED
└─ Available Buttons: [Withdraw ROI] ← User clicks here

STEP 2: Immediate Withdrawal
├─ Investment currentValue: $5,000 (ROI removed)
├─ Investment roiWithdrawn: TRUE
├─ User lockedBalance: +$750
├─ Withdrawal record: created with status 'pending'
└─ Message: "ROI withdrawn! Awaiting admin approval."

STEP 3: Admin Reviews
├─ Admin sees: "Pending ROI Withdrawal: $750"
├─ Buttons: [Approve] [Reject]
└─ Admin clicks: [Approve]

STEP 4: Admin Approves
├─ User lockedBalance: $750 → $0
├─ User availableBalance: $0 → $750
├─ Withdrawal status: 'pending' → 'confirmed'
└─ Message: "ROI approved! User can now withdraw."

STEP 5: User Withdraws to Wallet
├─ User availableBalance: $750 → $0
├─ Crypto sent: 0.00001 BTC (or equivalent)
├─ Withdrawal status: 'confirmed' → 'completed'
└─ Complete! ✓
```

## 📊 State Changes

### Investment State
```javascript
// BEFORE withdrawal
{
  _id: "inv123",
  amount: 5000,
  currentValue: 5750,      // With ROI
  roiWithdrawn: false,
  status: "completed"
}

// AFTER user withdraws ROI
{
  _id: "inv123",
  amount: 5000,
  currentValue: 5000,      // ROI removed! ← KEY CHANGE
  roiWithdrawn: true,      // Marked
  status: "completed",
  transactions: [
    { type: 'withdrawal', amount: 750, description: 'ROI Withdrawal' }
  ]
}
```

### User Balance State
```javascript
// BEFORE withdrawal
{
  availableBalance: 0,
  lockedBalance: 0
}

// AFTER user withdraws ROI (but before admin approves)
{
  availableBalance: 0,
  lockedBalance: 750      // ROI here! ← KEY CHANGE
}

// AFTER admin approves
{
  availableBalance: 750,  // Moved here! ← KEY CHANGE
  lockedBalance: 0
}
```
