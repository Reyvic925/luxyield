## 💻 The Five API Endpoints

```javascript
// 1. REJECT WITHDRAWAL
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/:id/reject
{ "reason": "optional" }

// 2. MOVE TO AVAILABLE (with fee)
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/:id/move-to-available
{ "feePercent": 5 }

// 3. ACCEPT WITHDRAWAL (with fee)
POST /api/admin/withdrawals/:id/accept
{ "feePercent": 2 }

// 4. GET WITHDRAWAL DETAILS
GET /api/admin/withdrawals/:id

// 5. LIST WITHDRAWALS (with filters)
GET /api/admin/withdrawals?status=rejected&type=roi&page=1
```

## 💰 Balance Management Example

```
START:
  User: lockedBalance=$0, availableBalance=$5,000

AFTER REQUEST ($1,000 withdrawal):
  Withdrawal: pending, amount=$1,000
  User: lockedBalance=$1,000, availableBalance=$5,000

SCENARIO A - REJECT & MOVE:
  1. Admin rejects
     → Withdrawal: rejected
     → User: lockedBalance=$1,000, availableBalance=$5,000 (unchanged)
  
  2. Admin moves with 5% fee
     → Withdrawal: moved_to_available
     → Fee: $50
     → User: lockedBalance=$0, availableBalance=$5,950
     → Platform keeps: $50

SCENARIO B - ACCEPT:
  1. Admin accepts with 2% fee
     → Withdrawal: completed
     → Fee: $20
     → User: lockedBalance=$0, availableBalance=$4,980
     → Platform keeps: $20
```

## ✅ Quick Verification

### Check Installation
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls server/routes/admin/withdrawalManagement.js

# Verify routes registered
grep withdrawalManagement server/routes/admin.js
```

### Test Endpoints
```bash
# Get admin token first
TOKEN="your_admin_jwt_token"

# List withdrawals
curl http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Reject a withdrawal
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/withdrawals/{id}/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Test"}'
```
