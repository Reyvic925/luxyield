# ROI WITHDRAWAL FIX - COMPLETE TESTING GUIDE

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your ROI withdrawal issue has been completely fixed! The problem was that ROI gains were calculated and added to your investment's current value, but **they were never added to your withdrawable balance (`availableBalance`)**.

### 3 Critical Issues Fixed:

1. **Daily ROI Script** - Now credits ROI to user's availableBalance
2. **ROI Cron Simulator** - Now credits ROI gains to user's availableBalance  
3. **Withdrawal Endpoint** - Now uses availableBalance instead of depositBalance

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Local Environment

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\luxyield-main

# Create MongoDB data directory (if not exists)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\luxyield-db"

# Start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\luxyield-db"
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

```bash
# In new terminal
cd server
npm start
```

Server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 3: Create Test User & Investment

```bash
# In server directory
node scripts/setup_test_data.js
```

Output will show:
```
✓ Created user: [USER_ID]
✓ Initial availableBalance: $0
✓ Initial lockedBalance: $5000
```

### Step 4: Run ROI Update

```bash
node scripts/update_roi.js
```

Output will show:
```
Updated investment [INV_ID] for user [USER_ID]: +$2.50 ROI (credited to availableBalance)
Updated ROI for 1 investments.
```

### Step 5: Verify ROI Was Credited

```bash
node scripts/verify_roi_fix.js
```

Output will show:
```
✅ PASS: User has withdrawable balance of $2.50
✅ PASS: ROI withdrawal is now ENABLED
✅ PASS: User can withdraw ROI without issue

🎉 ROI WITHDRAWAL FIX IS WORKING!
```

## 📊 Understanding the Fix

### Before Fix:
```
User Balance State:
  availableBalance = $0.00 ❌ (CANNOT withdraw)
  lockedBalance = $5000.00
  
Investment:
  initialAmount = $5000
  currentValue = $5002.50 (includes ROI)
  ROI = $2.50
```

### After Fix:
```
User Balance State:
  availableBalance = $2.50 ✅ (CAN NOW withdraw)
  lockedBalance = $5000.00
  
Investment:
  initialAmount = $5000
  currentValue = $5002.50
  ROI = $2.50
```

## 🔧 How ROI Flows Now

### Flow 1: Daily Script (runs as cron task)
```
Investment Gains ROI (+$X)
    ↓
Add transaction to investment history
    ↓
Increase investment.currentValue
    ↓
💡 NEW: Increment user.availableBalance by ROI amount ✅
```

### Flow 2: ROI Simulator Cron (runs every 5 minutes)
```
Generate random fluctuation for investment
    ↓
Add transaction to investment history
    ↓
Increase investment.currentValue
    ↓
💡 NEW: If gain > 0, increment user.availableBalance ✅
```

### Flow 3: User Withdrawal
```
User requests withdrawal of $X
    ↓
Check: availableBalance >= requestedAmount
    ↓
💡 FIXED: Uses availableBalance (not depositBalance) ✅
    ↓
Deduct from availableBalance
    ↓
Create withdrawal record
    ↓
Send crypto to user's wallet
```

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. server/scripts/update_roi.js
- Added: `require('dotenv').config()` 
- Added: `const User = require('../models/User')`
- Added: Credit ROI to availableBalance after each ROI transaction

### 2. server/utils/roiCalculator.js
- Added: `const User = require('../models/User')`
- Added: Credit gains to availableBalance (only if gain > 0)

### 3. server/routes/withdrawal.js
- Changed: Balance check from `depositBalance` → `availableBalance`
- Changed: Balance deduction from `depositBalance` → `availableBalance`

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single ROI Update
```bash
# Create test data
node scripts/setup_test_data.js

# Run ROI update once
node scripts/update_roi.js

# Verify
node scripts/verify_roi_fix.js
# Expected: availableBalance = $2.50+
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple ROI Updates
```bash
# Run update multiple times
for ($i=1; $i -le 3; $i++) { 
  node scripts/update_roi.js
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
}

# Verify balance grows
node scripts/verify_roi_fix.js
# Expected: availableBalance = $7.50+
```

### Scenario 3: Withdrawal After ROI Accrual
```bash
# Assuming user has $2.50+ available balance
# And withdrawal PIN is set

# POST to /api/withdrawal with:
# {
#   "amount": 2.50,
#   "currency": "USDT",
#   "network": "USDT",
#   "address": "wallet_address",
#   "pin": "123456"
# }

# Expected: Withdrawal accepted (availableBalance >= amount)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Updated ROI for 0 investments"
**Solution:** Make sure you ran `setup_test_data.js` first to create test data.

### Issue: "MONGO_URI is undefined"
**Solution:** Ensure server/.env file exists with:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/luxyield
```

### Issue: MongoDB connection error
**Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is running:
```bash
mongod --dbpath "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\luxyield-db"
```

### Issue: availableBalance still shows $0
**Solution:** 
1. Check server is running with updated code
2. Make sure you ran `update_roi.js` from the server directory
3. Restart server if you made code changes
